Hello!

This is my (Yash's) submission for the CSF assessment for the role of Software Developer.

Please download the contents of this repo. Here are the steps to run this project:

- Make sure to install the following npm packages: node, express, axios, cors, mongoose. (You can install packages using the command "npm install {package_name}"
- Open the backend folder and run the command "node index.js". (It is set to run on "localhost:3000")
- Open the frontend folder and run the command "npm run dev".

A few notes to consider:
- The database link is in the /db/index.js file, this can be avoided in real life by using a .env file.
