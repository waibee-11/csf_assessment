Hello!

This is my (Yash's) submission for the CSF assessment for the role of Software Developer.

Please download the contents of this repo. Here are the steps to run this project:

Open the backend folder and run the command "node index.js".
Open the frontend foler and run the command "npm run dev".

A few notes to consider:
- The database link is in the /db/index.js file, this can be avoided in real life by using a .env file.
